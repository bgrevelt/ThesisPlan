Part of Jakub Řezníček's master's thesis deals with the creation of a new corpus \cite[Ch 4 \& Appendix A]{jakubˇreznicek2010corpus}
Specifically looked into the selection of categories. I could not find much more than "Based on results from the research, we created several groups and sub-groups that should be enough to include the most common file types and to meet the requirements in the future."\cite{jakubˇreznicek2010corpus} without much clarification of what "the research" was exactly.
