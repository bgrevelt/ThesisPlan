\cite{buelens2006computational}\\
The authors discuss the current state and challenges in water column processing. They list the following topics as 'major challenges' in processing water column data:
\begin{itemize}
\item The data volume.
\item Automation of finding data of interest.
\item Object detection.
\item Object classification\\This is a broad subject that includes classification of the seabed (E.g. soil type) and the species of fish (schools).
\item (3D) visualization.
\end{itemize}

Overall it is a pretty shallow paper. Most important for my research is that the data volume of water column data is presented as one of the major challenges in water column processing.
