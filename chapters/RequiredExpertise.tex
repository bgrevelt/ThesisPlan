\chapterdecscription{
Give a list of the expertise that is needed for the successful completion of this project. Examples are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Java programming
\item Make and Makefiles
\item Configuration management
\item Testing
\item Etc., etc.
\end{itemize}
}
\begin{itemize}
\item Benchmarking % The obvious
\item WCD compression techniques % We need to understand compression in order to know which metrics are important to evaluate compression performance.
\item Applications of water column data. %We need to understand in which situations water column is stored in order to know what data should be used as input for the compression algorithms for the benchmark.
\item C programming (The water column compression algorithms are written in C )
\end{itemize}
