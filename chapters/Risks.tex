{\chapterdecscription{Give an assessment of the risks for this project and present counter measures. These may include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project goals are too ambitious.
\item Project goals are too vague.
\item The information about the project is unavailable/incomplete/too difficult.
\item The gap between your expertise and the required expertise is too large
\end{itemize}

    \hline
    Problem & Counter measure \\ \hline
    Limited knowledge of statistics   & Company supervisor to help out \\
    Not enough water column data available in the public domain & Start searching/requesting \textbf{now}               \\
    ~ & Create a corpus that is not available in the public domain.\\
    Authors of WCD compression algorithms do not provide algorithm & Request the algorithm \textbf{now}               \\
    ~       & All three methods are based on a standard compression algorithm (Huffman, JPEG2000 and FAPEC) with some preprocessing tailored to water column data. If we cannot get the algorithms the standard compression without tailoring can be used. \\
    ~ & Use 'standard' lossless compression (such as TAR, ZIP, etc.) for validation of the benchmark.\\
